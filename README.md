Task 1 [5]
Write a software that provides the functionality of an ATM machine. Information (like Pin code,
account number, name and balance) of five users is hard coded into the software. Any of the
users can use the system and withdraw the amount or enter more funds into his/her account.
When one user is finished using the ATM, it should not terminate the program but it displays a
welcome screen for the next user as it happens in the real ATM.
Task 2 [5]
Write a medical prescription system. The software displays a list of symptoms that the system
can handle and then takes in a variable number of symptoms from the user. Based on the
symptoms entered by the patient, the system shortlists the illnesses that he/she might have. After
shortlisting, if the there are more than one illness that is possible, system asks some additional
questions to pinpoint an illness. Software suggests a medicine for the patient based on the data
provided.
You need to research some common illnesses for this task.
